# Neural-Network-Image-Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (nural_clasification.ipynb) that demonstrates the implementation of a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for an Image Classification task, utilizing the Keras API within TensorFlow. The notebook focuses on data loading, preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and evaluation.
